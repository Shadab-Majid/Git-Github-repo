git add . (to tracked all changes.)
git add filename (to tracked specific file)

use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage
use git restore --staged  to unstage all


git commit -m"message"(to commit the changes into .git file)
git rm --cached test.txt (to remove version/data history from git repo)

by default track changes in local system if we want to hadle via github or other destributed system we can use this command

git remote add origin git@github.com:Shadab-Majid/Git-Github-repo.git

//if want to check the remote repo use this command 
git remote -v


// if want to push into remote repo use this command 
git push origin main

// if want to pull into remote repo use this command 
git pull origin main

//mering is the process of attaching any other branch changes to the current working branch.

command: 
git merge branch name 

//once we merge the changes in master or main we no need to that branch which we have merged so if we want we can remove that.
git branch -d branch_name

//stashing.
// if we want to to remove any uncommit changes and revert to its previous changes we can use(back-stage):
git stash 
git stash file_name

git stash pop (for getting the stash changes from the backstage.)

// Differece between the clonning and forking 

clonning : In cloning we pull any repo from the remote and do work on that. We push and pull directly to that repo and for doing this we need an access permission of that remote repo owner.

forking: forking is the process of copying any remote repo to you remote repo and then clone or pull that forked repo to you local device and do any changes and after changes we will push and pull from our forked repo and then if we want to add those changes inside the main repo we need to craete a pull request from our remote repo. 

// command to remove the remote device from your local 
git remote remove origin // your repo
git remote remove upstream // main repo which you have forked.


//steps of forking any project.

1. forked the repository first
2. clone your forked repo into your local machine via https or ssh
run this command: git clone https://github.com/shadab-majid/Spoon-Knife.git
3. Now you have your forked repo into your local machine now you need to update your forked repo with remote repo which you have forked.
run this command : git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
4. then check git remote -v 
it will show you your origin (which is your remote repo from your github or gitlab.) remote url and upstream url (which is your main repo url ) for fetch and pulling.
5. Now you only have remote fork repo chagnes you need to update pull changes from the upstream repo 
run this command : git fetch --all
after running this command it will show all branch of upstream repo .
6. then you need pull all changes from the upstream to your origin for doing this create respective branch according to the upstream repo and pull changes from that to your origin branch.
commands: 
suppose you have main and staging branch in upstream then follow this :

git checkout main 
git pull upstream main 
git push origin main 

git checkout -b staging 
git pull upstream staging 
git push origin staging

we can use this command to map the origin branch with local
git push -u origin rts-main:prod
git push -u origin rts-staging:master_civi

by doing this you have the updated code of upstream repo to your forked one.

7. After updating your fork from now if you do any changes to any branch then you need to push this to your origin branc then needs to crate a merge reques from you remote ui.
