Hello this is git repo.To open any file using cli write: vi file.name and to see the content of any file in cli: cat filename

git is working in our local system until we don't use any remote destributed control system like gitlab or github.

In our system git works in three directory:

working directory                           staging-area                                            .git (repository where git keep all records.)
(diretory where all files presetn)     (area where those files present which git can track)                 (this is the place where git store changes or tracking the changes of commited files.)
                                        

whatever files or work we                  once we run git add . or add any file that will comm             once we commit any changes that file or changes ss will come
will do store here initially.              to this area which can be tracked by git.                        to this repo and from now whatever changes will happen to this file 
This is the untracked area which                                                                             and if that get commit it will show the changes information by using git log.
can't be tracked by git means git don't 
know about this files.
